name,dialog
SpongeBob," This is it, Gary!"
Gary," Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words ""boating exam today!"" on it then drops to the floor]"
SpongeBob," The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!"
Squidward, What?
SpongeBob," I'm ready, Squidward! [rides his unicycle around Squidward's house]"
Squidward, Ready to move?
SpongeBob," No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [rides his unicycle towards Mrs. Puff's Boating School] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!"
SpongeBob," [snaps his fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next!"
SpongeBob," Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. [jumps around the boardwalk. Camera goes inside the school, as a female pufferfish looks out the window and sees SpongeBob jumping around.]"
Puff, [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door]
SpongeBob," Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!"
Puff," [with a clipboard and a pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must..."
SpongeBob, First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Puff," I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?"
SpongeBob, The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Puff, What is the back?
SpongeBob, Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Puff, #3: Right is...
SpongeBob, Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers]
Puff," You've passed the oral test. [sarcastically] What a surprise. [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat."
SpongeBob," Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already?"
Puff," Get in the boat, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob," Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes his eyes with a smile]"
Puff, All you have to do is get on the track.
Puff," Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?"
SpongeBob, 1924...?
Puff," No, no. First thing is to start the boat. [turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat."
SpongeBob, The boat?
Puff," Okay, now what do you do next?"
SpongeBob, Floor it?
Puff," Yes... no! No, don't floor it."
SpongeBob, Floor it?!
Puff," No, no, don't, don't floor it!"
SpongeBob," Okay, floor it! [SpongeBob slams on the accelerator and starts driving backwards really fast]"
Puff," No! No, no, no, nooooo! [the boat whizzes by some spectators before crashing into a lighthouse. After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates to three times her size. The lighthouse falls, and Mrs. Puff speaks with a deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why?"
Fred, My leg...!
SpongeBob," [in his bed at night] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it 37 times."
Gary, Meow.
SpongeBob," Okay, 38. [puts his pillow on his head]"
Gary, [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow.
SpongeBob," No, Gary, I'm not walking."
Patrick," [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is Star Ranger, over."
SpongeBob," [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick?"
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob," [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood."
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed]
SpongeBob," [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick?"
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door]
SpongeBob," [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet."
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob," [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [opens the closet door, revealing Patrick wearing SpongeBob's clothes]"
Patrick, Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob," [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about."
Patrick, What's the problem?
SpongeBob, I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it 37...
Gary, Meow.
SpongeBob," ...uhh, 38 times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight."
Patrick, Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie]
SpongeBob, How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top]
Patrick," Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?"
SpongeBob," Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window]"
Patrick," [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! [loudly] Testing! [screams] Test, test. Do you read?!"
SpongeBob," Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over."
Patrick," [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. [focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat, then gets on the ground on all fours and starts chewing grass.]"
SpongeBob, [Moos like a cow]
Patrick," [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. An ambulance arrives with its siren on and drops off Mrs. Puff] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple]"
SpongeBob," Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows]"
Puff, Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection]
SpongeBob, [starts to get scared] Uhh...
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob starts the boat. The engine starting up causes Mrs. Puff to go crazy]
SpongeBob, Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Puff, Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob," It's okay, it's only the boat."
Puff, The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob, I... I think so.
Puff, Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob, 1924?
Patrick," [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive."
SpongeBob, Put it in drive?
Puff," Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive. Then what?"
SpongeBob, [lifts leg up] Floor it?
Puff, No! [screams] No!
Patrick," [through walkie-talkie] Freeze, mister! [SpongeBob stops] Big toe. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down]"
Puff," Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet."
Patrick," [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [a giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve]"
Puff," Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn!"
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] Left. [SpongeBob turns left]
Puff, Oh!
Patrick, [through walkie-talkie] Right. [SpongeBob turns right]
Puff," Oh! My, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine."
Montage," [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.]"
Puff," Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs again] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs a third time] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating."
Patrick, Cheating! [laughing hysterically]
SpongeBob, I'm cheating?! Mrs. Puff!
Puff," Yes, my star pupil?"
SpongeBob, I think I'm cheating.
Puff," What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff]"
SpongeBob, I think I am cheating!
Puff, You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob, I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows the antenna under his hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick," What?! [runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying]"
SpongeBob," I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!"
Puff," [panicking] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel..."
SpongeBob, Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Puff," No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!"
SpongeBob, No... I'm cheating...!
Puff," At least, SpongeBob..."
SpongeBob, I'm cheating!
Puff, Cheat that way! That way!
SpongeBob," I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!"
Puff, It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob, No...!
Puff, That way! That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob, Cheater...! [crashes offscreen head-on into the same lighthouse. Mrs. Puff inflates with a look of despair. The lighthouse falls yet again]
Puff," [deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why?"
SpongeBob," Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated."
Fred," My leg! [some time later, EMTs are wheeling a still-inflated Mrs. Puff away on a gurney]"
SpongeBob," Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff."
Puff," [normal voice] It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance]"
SpongeBob," Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike."
Gary, [with SpongeBob's unicycle] Meow.
SpongeBob," Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!"
SpongeBob," Wake up, Gary."
Gary, [wakes up] Meow?
SpongeBob, We're moving today!
Gary, [quizzically] Meow?
SpongeBob, That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! [puts on a hat and fake beard]
Gary, Meow.
SpongeBob," [takes away Gary's bowl] No more food. [gives Gary a plate with clams on it] Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clam shells. [SpongeBob puts salt in the shells, and Gary starts crying] April Fools! [takes off the outfit and puts Gary's food bowl back onto the floor] There ya go, pal!"
Gary, Meow. [eats]
SpongeBob," [goes into the kitchen] Whew, I'm thirsty! [takes a big glass of lemonade out of the fridge] [deep male voice] This is an extreme thirst! [sets the lemonade down on the floor; bubble transition to him putting all the lemonade into a lot of small glasses with umbrellas]"
SpongeBob," [normal voice] Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all these drinks! April Fools! [holds up a mirror] To me! [laughs obnoxiously and walks outside and towards work. Squidward sees him]"
Squidward," What's he so happy about? [walks by the calendar and notices it's April Fools Day. He panics] April 1st?! [screams] April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday! [puts a heating pad on his head and dials the number for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible."
Krabs, [over phone] What'd you catch?
Squidward, I caught sight of the calendar.
Krabs," Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month."
Squidward, I have arrived. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh] What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
Krabs, You just missed him.
SpongeBob," Yeah, but he told us to tell you..."
Squidward, Tell me what?
SpongeBob, [whispers into Squidward's ear] He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward," [lays his hat on the table] Well, it's been nice working here. [he walks off] Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs."
SpongeBob," Squidward, wait!"
Squidward," Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!"
SpongeBob," Wait, Squidward! [grabs Squidward's legs] It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!"
Squidward, You do?
SpongeBob," Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?"
Squidward," Well, as long as it's not me."
Shell," Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?"
SpongeBob," They're right here, lady! [leads her to the utensils]"
Shell, [picks up a spoon] But this is a spoon.
SpongeBob, April Fools! [laughs; Squidward stares at SpongeBob and he runs away; bubble transition to SpongeBob behind the register; a customer comes up to him] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Nat," [raises up his left arm] Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty."
SpongeBob," [points at something] Hey, what's that?"
Nat," Well, I didn't see anything. [notices that SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd that other guy go?"
SpongeBob, April Fools! I'm right here!
Nat," [laughs] Hey, that was pretty good."
Squidward, What are you doing behind the counter?!
Tom," Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?"
SpongeBob, Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! [fills the cup with ice and comes back whistling] Here you go.
Tom," Thanks. [he takes a sip of his drink; SpongeBob titters and Tom looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before Tom turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom takes another sip of his drink; SpongeBob starts giggling again and then Tom turns around and looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before he turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom finishes his drink] Ah..."
SpongeBob," [laughs loudly and obnoxiously] April Fools! [Tom grabs SpongeBob by the collar, suddenly panicked]"
Tom, What did you do to my drink?!
SpongeBob, I... [giggles] I... [giggles]
Tom, You what?!
SpongeBob," You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! [laughs]"
Tom, I guess that is pretty funny. [laughs as he walks off] Yeah.
SpongeBob," [laughs so hard his tongue pops off] Hey, your shoes untied. [tongue looks down] April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! [laughs and hugs his tongue, which smiles. Then they laugh into the microphone; everyone hears it; in the kitchen, Squidward tries to mute the sound with tissues, but he can still hear it] April Fools! [Squidward drops a plate]"
Squidward, That's it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! [bubble transition to him squirting some mustard inside a rope circle then he chuckles and shows SpongeBob the mess]
SpongeBob," Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up! [starts cleaning it and Squidward is standing next to a rope which he is about to cut]"
Squidward, April Fools! [laughs as he cuts the rope which grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob, Whooaahh! [the rope sends him into some bags of flour. Squidward is laughing through all of this and rolls on the floor. Then SpongeBob is taken around a bar] Whoa! Blblblblblblbl... [screams as he is sent slamming face-first into the wall]
Customers," Oh, no!"
SpongeBob," Whoooaa! [Cut to Squidward cheerleading, laughing, and jumping into the air. Then SpongeBob smashes into the ceiling]"
Squidward," [runs and holds out his arms to catch SpongeBob] I'll catch you, SpongeBob! [he giggles to himself. SpongeBob screams as he plummets toward Squidward, who quickly sets out a garbage can in front of him, and SpongeBob falls into the goop in the can] Oops. [dumps SpongeBob, who is now the shape of the can, out of the garbage can] April Fools, you little sausage! [he laughs; SpongeBob sobs hysterically and runs out of the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You guys know I was just kidding… Right?"
Wobbles," Aww, man, poor kid."
Shubie, That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. [The customers angrily glare at Squidward as they begin to leave]
fish, April Fools... jerk. [All the customers storm out the door in disgust as Squidward starts to look upset by their reaction]
Squidward," Wait, don't go!"
Man," Hey, you stink!"
Squidward," Wait, wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh-huh... [looks around at the mess he has made and winces, then he looks at Bubble Bass, who has a hole in his bottom due to the ""prank"" and Squidward starts to feel ashamed of himself] Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach. [makes silly face] Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo- [throat goes haywire] gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought. [bubble transition to Squidward going to SpongeBob's pineapple; he knocks on SpongeBob's door] SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob? [notices a Krusty Krab hat and goes over there to talk to the man who is wearing it] Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I'm... What? [notices that the guy with the hat on is Patrick] Patrick?! What are you doing here?!"
Patrick, Digging.
Squidward, Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick," Oh, I don't know. [takes off the hat]"
Squidward, [growls] Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick, He's in the house. He's impressed.
Squidward, With what?
Patrick," I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that."
Squidward," [shivers then goes back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there! [tries to turn the handle, but SpongeBob's arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside; Squidward grabs his clarinet] SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! [plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens the door]"
SpongeBob, What do you want?
Squidward," SpongeBob, I just want to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. [sticks out tongue while talking]"
SpongeBob, What?
Squidward, I'm trying to say I'm [turns into a donkey and starts braying] haw-hee-haw!
SpongeBob, What?!
Squidward," I'm just trying to say I'm... [voice muffled after his head explodes] There's gotta be an easier way to do this. [bubble transition to Squidward writing a note; he puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up] Well, aren't you going to open it?"
SpongeBob, I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
Squidward," Doh! [Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road] SpongeBob, I'm... [whispers into the can, then puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise; Patrick is flossing his teeth with the cord; Squidward growls and throws the binoculars down on the ground] SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... [waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form, puts a big bubble on his head and then talks] ...sorry. [pops the bubble] There you go."
SpongeBob, But I couldn't... [Squidward slams the door in his face]
Squidward," I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! [Starts to walk away, when an image of Patrick appears in the air]"
Patrick, Must've been pretty good to make him cry like that. [Squidward nervously continues walking and runs into a ghost image of a guy at the Krusty Krab]
Tom," April Fools... jerk. [Squidward frantically starts running again, but this time his mother appears]"
Tentacles, [male voice] You stink!
Squidward," Mother?! [runs back to SpongeBob's house to apologize] All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and, and... [SpongeBob opens the door slightly]"
SpongeBob, Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward," Yes, yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true."
SpongeBob, Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward," What the...? Yes, yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody."
SpongeBob, I promise.
Squidward," Really? [SpongeBob opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside]"
Everyone, April Fools!
Squidward," [eye twitches] April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! [laughs hysterically while going back into his house]"
SpongeBob, What would we do without Squidward?
Narrator," Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy next to a tent]"
Sandy," Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimming when you're in a shirt and tie?"
SpongeBob," Ah, yes. How foolish of me. [cackles] Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. [goes into the tent, then pokes his head out] And I won't do anything else. [puts his head back in]"
Sandy, SpongeBob's acting jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
SpongeBob," [laughs] Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! [puts on his headgear that was in the bag] Hi-yah! [puts on his karate gloves that was in the bag] Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! [kicks the bag]"
Sandy," SpongeBob, are you ready?"
SpongeBob," Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! [softly] Ready to get it on. [jumps out of the tent towards Sandy] Hi..."
Sandy," Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob in his mouth] Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear."
SpongeBob," [muffled laughter] Great minds think alike, I suppose."
Sandy," Hi-yah! [karate chops him into the air. SpongeBob crashes into the ground, followed by his pants, socks, and shoes. He stands up with the clothing on his head and feet in some food]"
SpongeBob," I may be down, but I'm not out! [looks down at his wiggly toes, which are in some potato salad at a family picnic]"
Tom," Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad. [SpongeBob jumps away] Three days!"
SpongeBob, [jumps into an empty area] Hi-yah! Sandy?
Sandy," Oh, I'm Sandy, alright. [her arms come out of the ground and squish SpongeBob's face] I'm very Sandy. [kicks SpongeBob into the air] Hi-yah!"
SpongeBob," Oh, I get it. She's ""Sandy."" That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! [flies out of the water then back into it. Scene cuts to Sandy talking to an ice cream vendor]"
Sandy," Back in Texas, we call ice cream ""frozen cow juice"". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob in the face with her karate glove] Thank you."
Vendor," No, no, thank you."
Sandy," Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob again, sending him into the air and flying into a strong fish that is waiting in line]"
Sandy," Hey, what's everybody waiting in line for?"
SpongeBob, Ew. [a fish is screaming while flying out of the Salty Spitoon]
Sandy," Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob," Yeah, let's go in."
Reg, [lets a fish walk in] Go ahead. [line moves up] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Reg," Yeah, so?"
Reg," Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. [tough fish walks in. Sandy walks up to Reg] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?"
Sandy," How tough am I? [rips off one of his tattoos that says ""MOM"" and puts it upside down back where it was. Reg screams in pain when Sandy rips off the tattoo]"
SpongeBob, Wow.
Sandy, Got any more tattoos? [Reg covers the upside down tattoo with his arms]
Reg," Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead."
Sandy," Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! [walks in]"
Reg, How tough are ya?
SpongeBob, How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
Reg, Sure. [hands the bottle of ketchup to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob," It's on! [strains to open it, but he can't, takes a few breathes, tries to open the ketchup bottle again, but same result, then gives up] If I could just run this under some hot water..."
Reg," Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man."
SpongeBob," Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes."
Reg," Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place. [points to the building across the street]"
SpongeBob, Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg," Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it. [points to another building]"
SpongeBob, Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg, Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in a seat at Weenie Hut Jr's]
SpongeBob," [snorts] What weenies. Oh, brother."
Robot," [robotic voice] Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?"
SpongeBob, What? But I'm not a weenie! [the robot scans SpongeBob with one of its scanners]
Robot," I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie. [computer beeps and shows a picture of a hot dog weenie with the word ""YES"" below it]"
SpongeBob, That's impossible! [the two nerds look at him. He runs off]
Robot, You can't hide what's inside!
SpongeBob," [runs over to Reg] I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! [a strong, orange fish walks up]"
Reg," You were sayin'? [to orange fish] Go ahead, buddy."
SpongeBob," So, your name's Reg?"
Reg, [throws SpongeBob aside] Would you get outta here?
SpongeBob," Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! [runs off. Scene cuts to Weenie Hut Jr's]"
Robot, I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
Drifter," What's shakin', my man?"
Reg," Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?"
Drifter," Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out."
Reg," Nice try, kid. I know it's you."
Drifter," What're you talking about? [Reg pulls Drifter's hair, but it is still attached to his head, it's real hair]"
Reg, Aha! [the hair does not come off. SpongeBob walks up with a clown wig on]
SpongeBob," Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? [the Drifter gets angry as Reg tries to redo his hair, but can't do it]"
Reg," Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that. [Drifter angrily walks in] Well, what do you want?"
SpongeBob," I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. [Reg takes the wig off SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs nervously] So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? [a big, green fish walks up with a tattoo of a seahorse on his right arm]"
Reg," Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink."
Reg," [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, what about that one? [the big, green fish looks at his left arm that has a SpongeBob tattoo on it]"
Reg, Can you make it dance?
SpongeBob," Ha-cha-cha-cha, ha-cha-cha-cha, ha-chattity-chattity-cha!"
Reg," Hmmm, wait a minute. [rips SpongeBob off his arm] Go ahead in. [the tattoo fish walks in, rubbing his left arm]"
Reg," Nice try, little man. [throws SpongeBob to the back of the line behind two strong fish]"
Reg," Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in."
SpongeBob," Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. [He dusts his clothes using his hands]"
Reg," [chortles] I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk."
SpongeBob," Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. [spins his legs, then his hands, and then cracks his fingers, but they are snapped in half. The scene cuts out to SpongeBob's broken fingers. He starts to cry and runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his fingers in a bowl of ice cream, whimpering]"
Robot," Care for another sundae, weenie?"
SpongeBob, [jumps angrily] I am not a weenie!
SpongeBob, My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. [scroll over to Patrick in the seat next to him]
Patrick," You tell 'em, SpongeBob! [sips his drink]"
SpongeBob," Patrick, what're you doing here?"
Patrick, I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Patrick," Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?"
Patrick, Barnacles!
SpongeBob, I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon! [begins to walks out]
Patrick," No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous."
SpongeBob, I've got no choice.
Robot, I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
Patrick," Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon."
SpongeBob," Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!"
Patrick, Yeah! [both run out]
Robot," I am a robot, not a miracle worker. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Reg]"
SpongeBob," Afternoon, Reg."
Reg," Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in."
SpongeBob," Well, that makes me pretty mad."
Reg," Oh, yeah?"
SpongeBob, Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
Reg, [sarcastically] Wow.
SpongeBob," Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny."
Reg, Hmmm... what about that guy? [points to a large muscular fish behind him]
SpongeBob," [gasps and stammers] I, uh... [laughs] don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! [points to Patrick]"
Patrick," Who, me? [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]"
SpongeBob," Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!"
Patrick," Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh... [looks at his hand, which has writing on it] ...kickboxer. [winks and gives a thumbs-up to SpongeBob]"
SpongeBob," I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! [Patrick starts to tear up]"
Patrick," Tubby? [Patrick's sadness is quickly replaced by fury and he turns red and snarls with rage] Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! [angrily punches SpongeBob in the eye, leaving a black mark]"
SpongeBob," Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?"
Patrick," Oh yeah. [invisible punches flying] No, please wait. [grunting as more invisible punches hit him and an elephant sound is heard when Patrick's head is hit. Patrick is being thrown into the air and on the ground, then given a wedgie] No, please, have mercy! [Patrick is kicked into the background]"
Reg, Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him. [Patrick is still getting beaten in the background]
SpongeBob, I did?
Reg," I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in."
SpongeBob," Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! [walks in as Reg smiles. Scene cuts to an ambulance driving down the street with SpongeBob in bandages and Sandy by his side] Sandy? [groans] What happened?"
Sandy, You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. [ambulance arrives at the hospital. Scene cuts to Sandy wheeling SpongeBob on a gurney in front of the doctor]
Doctor, What happened?
SpongeBob, I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos!
Doctor," Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital. [points across the street to Weenie Hut General]"
SpongeBob, Weenie Hut General?!
Fran," Squidward, we love you!"
Squidward," Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous. [Plays a few notes on his clarinet] Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. [laughs]"
SpongeBob," Time for another glorious day at work. [winks at his tie, the tie winks back] Good morning, Squidward! [walks down the street with Squidward] And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?"
Squidward," I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob."
SpongeBob," See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?"
Sandy," Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye."
SpongeBob," Ooh, that sounds fancy."
Sandy, Let me show you how it works. [puts an apple in the transporter]
SpongeBob, Whoa! [apple disappears] Where'd it go?
Sandy, Just where you think it would be. [apple appears on Mrs. Puff's desk]
Puff, Oh!
SpongeBob," Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?"
Sandy," I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob, Whoo-hoo! [goes into transporter]
Sandy, Hold on tight.
SpongeBob," [transporter starts] Gee, Sandy, this sure feels..."
Squidward," [walking up to the Krusty Krab] Well, here we go again. [as he reaches for the door, SpongeBob appears and Squidward's arm is attached through SpongeBob's body]"
SpongeBob," Hey, Squidward! [laughs. Sandy's remote is going haywire]"
Sandy, What's going on with this thing? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported back to Sandy's machine] What in tarnation? [gasps. SpongeBob and Squidward are mutated into one body]
SpongeBob," Hi, Sandy!"
Squidward," I'm not sure what it is, but something seems different about me."
SpongeBob," Yeah, me too."
Squidward," Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together. [tries to detach himself, but fails] This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow!"
SpongeBob," Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever."
Squidward," [screams] Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated!"
Sandy," Well, I wish I knew how."
Squidward," Well, you have to do something! I can't stay stuck to him!"
Sandy," Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter."
Squidward," Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it."
Sandy," Well, here goes nothing. [transports to Bikini Bottom Elementary]"
Mable," All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready, Timmy? [opens present. SpongeBob and Squidward rise up from the box, still mutated together. Mable screams as SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again]"
Doctor," Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy."
Smith, May I see my baby?
Doctor, Of course. [baby appears as SpongeBob & Squidward mutated into one body again. Mrs. Smith screams as they are transported again]
Monster," I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you. [both monsters kiss. SpongeBob and Squidward appear between them] Hey, baby, what's your name? [SpongeBob and Squidward get transported again. The lady monster slaps the one-eyed monster's face and leaves]"
Squidward," It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same."
Sandy," Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage."
Squidward, Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.
Sandy," I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up."
SpongeBob, Together forever.
Squidward," Misery. [later, SpongeBob and Squidward are riding a bike to work] SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?"
SpongeBob," Don't worry, I'll drive."
Squidward," [Squidward's head bumps against the wheel of the bike] Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [both enter the Krusty Krab riding the bike. The bike crashes into the boat and they fly through the kitchen window]"
Krabs, [enters kitchen] What in blazes is going on in here?
SpongeBob," Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs."
Krabs, What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
Squidward," If you say so. [as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out]"
Krabs," Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs."
SpongeBob," Aye aye, cap'n!"
Squidward, Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
SpongeBob," Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon."
Squidward, I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. [stretches his head through the kitchen window] Whew. Can I help you?
Squidward," SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob, Two Krabby Patties coming right up. [notices the buns are out of reach] I can't... reach the buns.
Krabs," SpongeBob, what's the holdup?!"
SpongeBob," Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it."
Krabs," Time is money, boy."
SpongeBob," Time is money. Right. [reaches bun] Hello, bun. At last we meet. [Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob] And now for the-"
Krabs," Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. [pushes them out the restaurant] And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out."
SpongeBob," Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other."
Squidward," That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. [plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer]"
Surfer," Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!"
Squidward, Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
Sandy, Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.
Squidward," Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night."
Sandy," Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet."
Squidward, What'd you say?
Sandy," I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]"
Squidward," What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak! [SpongeBob smiles] Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show!"
Sandy," Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. [Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together]"
Squidward," Of course. [at the clarinet recital] Oh, my. [not an empty seat in the house] Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there."
SpongeBob," Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!"
Squidward, Superstar?
SpongeBob, Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!
Squidward, You're right! The show must go on!
Announcer," Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. [curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it]"
Evelyn," Honey, I'm scared. [the crowd continues to dislike Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps]"
SpongeBob," Uhh, hi."
Wobbles," Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! [crowd cheers]"
SpongeBob," Wow, they really liked it."
Krabs," [laughing] There you go, Squiddy!"
Squidward," They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... [smells the air] ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating."
Sandy," Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time."
Squidward, Sandy?
Sandy," One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. [SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps]"
Squidward," [SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet] Hmph. [plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair]"
Mary," I think I'm going to be sick! [Squidward blows his clarinet at Billy, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton]"
Billy," Ah, I'm out of here!"
Squidward," Huh, no, wait. Wait! [everyone leaves] Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. [grabs the Molecular Separator Ray] There's got to be some way to reverse this. [pushes the button over and over]"
Sandy," No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!"
SpongeBob," Squidward, I wouldn't--! [laser blasts into the final scene]"
Therapist," So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?"
Squidward," It all started when I was born. [camera zooms out to show Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, SpongeBob, and Squidward deformed and misshapen into a liquid ball of the fused characters]"
Krabs," [The scene goes back to the Krusty Krab where it shows SpongeBob in a Superhero-like costume (not his Mermaid Man Costume) at the register and Mr. Krabs holding a bag of Money] Gotta hand it to ya, boy. [The image changes to just show Mr. Krabs with the money] Gettin' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to shoot for me restaurant was a stroke of genius."
SpongeBob," [The images changes back to show both of them. Mr. Krabs walks away.] All in the line of duty, Mr. Krabs. [Squidward crawls over to the register with a torn uniform. He is groaning] Isn't it great, Squidward?"
Squidward, Great? [He looks and points in the opposite direction of SpongeBob] Those little savages tried to kill me.
SpongeBob," Yeah, but it's so worth it when you get to work in these. [shows his uniform which consists of red underwear and a disguise mask around his eyes, and you hear a five-note poorly played trumpet fanfare]"
Plankton," [The scene returns to the Chum Bucket and Plankton still looking through his periscope] Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this? [The scene returns to the Krusty Krab where it shows Karen and Mr. Krabs talking and laughing (Plankton's voice is blocking what they say)] Karen? [The image changes to show (through the Krusty Krab window) the exterior of the Chum Bucket with Plankton's Periscope, which shows his eye] My own wife?! [The scene changes to show Plankton inside the chum bucket; the door is also shown] Oh, how Krabs mocks me. [He pushes his periscope back up]"
Karen," [opens doors to Chum Bucket] Hi, honey."
Plankton, [He turns around] What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend Krabs?
Karen," [The image changes to show Karen's face] Oh, pipe down. I just went to get you this [The image changes to show [Plankton looking mad and Karen's hand putting down the Kids Meal box] happy hero box."
Plankton," Wha...?! [jumps on top of the box] Thanks, babe. You're too good to me. [opens the box and gasps] A Mermaid Man action figure...And a Barnacle Boy eraser?! [Jumps down and plays with the toys] Look at me. I'm Barnacle Boy. Look at me. I'm Mermaid Man. [The scene pans out to show Mr. Krabs on the box] Krabs! [hits the side of the box with Krabs' picture on it with his new toys while laughing. He jumps on top of the box and continues to laugh. He jumps off of it. The crushed box is shown.] Sure! Why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too. [maniacal laughter. The scene changes to show the exterior of Shady Shoals Rest Home. Snoring can be heard. The scene changes to show the bottom of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's room door. The snoring continues] Ding dong. [door opens. Plankton is wearing a plaid, yellow shirt, a red bow tie, and a boater hat with a yellow stripe] Hello, boys. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are the ones snoring, they wake up]"
Boy, What? What? What?
Plankton," I'm Down Here, Fellas!"
Man, Who are you?
Plankton," [Hops onto Mermaid Man's foot] Oh, Professor Plankton, Door-to-door salesman. [gets out a card] My card."
Man," [takes card and reads it] ""Professor Plankton's Personal Products?"""
Plankton," Say, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right? [An ugly image of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy is seen. A scream and glass breaking can be heard.] I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin. [Barnacle Boy's chin has zits and bumps in it and you hear a horse neigh] Those chiseled features. [Mermaid Man's ears has hair growing out of it and zits all over and you hear a monkey scream] That bra. [An elephant is heard. He then jumps to his neck.] But what's this? Dandruff?"
Man, I've got dandruff?
Plankton, You sure do. [pours laundry soap around his neck] See?
Man," Oh, my! [looks at soap]"
Plankton," [He goes over to Barnacle Boy's head and lifts up Barnacle Boy's hat but sees there is real dandruff under there. The scene zooms in and shows the dandruff in more detail and snow bells jingling is heard] Ew! [He then moves back to Mermaid Man's foot] Couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr. Plankton's come prepared with ""Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo"". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door."
Boy," [Barnacle Boy pulls a lever which moves their couch back until it is flat] Sign us up, Professor."
Plankton," [He moves to the now-flat back of the couch between both Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy] Wise decision, gentlemen. [rubs the shampoo into both of their scalps while humming happily] Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked. [both are now under Plankton's control] Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder. [tears off the dandruff tag a little on the shampoo bottle] Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo! It's Professor Plankton's [Pulls of the rest of the tag] Mind Control Shampoo! [laughs] With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas, as my zombies! [laughs. The scene changes, through a card that says ""Wipe!"", to the Krusty Krab where there is a gigantic line outside and giant Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy balloons above the building]"
Kids," [chanting] We want Mermaid Man! We want Barnacle Boy! [kids throw Squidward into the window, which solidly flattens and Squidward slides away. The kids chant some more while throwing stuff around] We want Mermaid Man! We want Barnacle Boy! We want Mermaid Man!..."
Krabs," Uh, hey, kids? [The kids stop chanting] Uh, well, there's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the ballroom. [all the kids run inside the ballroom and Mr. Krabs closes the door behind them to keep them inside] SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob," [He jogs over] Yes, sir."
Krabs," Go get those AWOL do-gooders you talked me into hirin', and bring their patoots back here on the double!"
SpongeBob," Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. [He runs off-screen]"
Krabs," [Grabs a broom] Back, you! Back!"
SpongeBob," [He goes over to the receptionist] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, please. And I'm kind of in a hurry. [The receptionist shrieks and ducks as a chair is thrown and breaks above him. While waiting, SpongeBob whistle-sings a song] Doot, do, doot-do, doot... [Mermaid Man taps him on the shoulder. SpongeBob gasps then shrieks. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy growl at him while under Plankton's control] Oh, my gosh. You guys live in a dump! But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take ya. [Mermaid Man takes SpongeBob's hand and does the Spine Blaster on him while he grunts.] Wow! I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since... [Mermaid Man does Spine Blaster on SpongeBob again and he again grunts.] ...since episode 647. [Mermaid Man does the Spine Blaster on SpongeBob once again and he still grunts] When you blasted that guy's spine. [He whimpers while getting up] You still got it. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drag SpongeBob off. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab]"
Perkins," Perch Perkins here, live at the Krusty Krab. We're just moments away from an important press conference with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have with me here Eugene Krabs, owner of the restaurant. Any thoughts, Mr. Krabs?"
Krabs, [muttering gibberish because of all the money in his pocket]
Perch," [chuckles] Oh, okay. We'll come back to you later. [SpongeBob comes crashing down through the ceiling]"
SpongeBob," Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy crash through the side of the Krusty Krab. All the kids break through the ballroom cage and run up to their heroes cheering. But Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy throw them aside and go up to the press conference booths while the cameras flash. They growl.]"
Plankton," [hiding in Mermaid Man's right ear] Oh, boy! Everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet. [maniacal laughter]"
Perch," Mermaid Man, [Clearly and slower than normal.] what is your opinion of the Krabby Patty?"
Plankton, Ooh! This is too easy. Now just tell everyone that... [whispers into his ear]
Man," I, Mermaid Man, think that Krabby Patties are, uh... uh, what?"
Plankton, They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties.
Man," I'm late for ""Snappy Pabbies?"" Barnacle Boy, [He Slaps him which makes him come out of the trance] we're late for... [snores]"
Plankton," Oh, for crying out loud! [walks up to his ear drum] Tell them you hate Krabby Patties! [Mermaid Man snores then exhales. Plankton gets frustrated and goes through the ear canal]"
Man, Wha?...
SpongeBob," [Off-Screen] Mermaid Man. [now on-screen, whispering] I brought you something to refresh your memory. [He pulls out a Krabby Patty]"
Man," [Off-Screen] Ooh, a Krabby Patty! [now on-screen, he takes the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob.] Would you look at that? [He moves back to Barnacle Boy] Barnacle Boy, it's a Krabby Patty. Why, these things are... [becomes under the mind control again] ...evil!"
Frank," Susie, no! [slaps her patty away]"
Man," I hate these nasty things! [spits on it, SpongeBob becomes broken and cracks into pieces]. And furthermore..."
Plankton," [talks through a microphone inside Mermaid Man] ...let it be known that I, Mermaid Man prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket."
Man, Your new favorite restaurant!
SpongeBob, The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this.
Plankton, Yes. Yes! [He is shown in the pupil of Mermaid Man] It's working. [Laughs. The crowd is mumbling disgustedly and exit the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob, Hold it right there! You forgot your...Krabby Patties!
Boy, [They get out of the mind control and drool] Krabby Patties. Krabby Patties!
Plankton," Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [Plankton turns a switch to slap Mermaid Man from eating a Krabby Patty. They return back to being under the mind control. Plankton makes Mermaid Man throw one away and then stomp on the one that Barnacle Boy had. Then they walk out and walk past SpongeBob, knocking him over. They are stopped by SpongeBob]"
SpongeBob," Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook! It's time for you to meet... [throws an exploding capsule on the ground] Fry Boy, Defender of... Ow! [notices his that his outfit hasn't changed, so, he uses another exploding capsule to put on another outfit] Fry Boy... [ He is now wearing a superhero costume that features two Krabby Patties, two Spatulas, and a cape. His voice becomes deep and he has a large chin.] ...Defender of the Krabby Patty! [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy growl and run after SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws the patties up into the air and hits them with his spatulas sending them to Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy but the heroes duck. SpongeBob jumps. The heroes continue to run. SpongeBob stretches his arms around some coral and sends the heroes back towards him. He trips them into the ground and eating a Krabby Patty] Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic! [nothing happens except Barnacle Boy checking his watch so Plankton shrugs and pushes the lever again and sends the heroes over to the Chum Bucket]"
Plankton," I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers. [evil laugh] In your face, Krabs. Yes!"
Harold," So, uh, where's the food?"
Plankton," [laughs evil. Gasps] Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far. [goes into the kitchen]"
SpongeBob," It doesn't make sense. [He pops his head out] They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... That's it! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are elderly. [Scene changes to inside Mermaid Man's stomach] Their poor aging tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. [Scene changes back to SpongeBob] I know just what to do! [He exits the hole and runs away. He crashes through the Chum Bucket's wall with a ""fiber"" truck and pours fiber into the heroes mouths. Their stomachs rumble and digest the food and they go return to their normal selves.]"
Man," I'm back to my old self again! Thanks to you, SpongeBob."
SpongeBob," And the delicious power of Krabby Patties. [He looks at the ""camera"" almost like it is a commercial.]"
Man," Say, I could use a couple more of those, and an order of Krabby Fries."
Boy, [walks out of the bathroom] And a decent latrine.
SpongeBob," Well, then, you guys know where to go!"
Boy, To the Krusty Krab! Away! [everyone goes over to the Krusty Krab]
Plankton," Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes! [Plankton screams as he sees everyone at the Krusty Krab]"
Patrick," ♪Squidward had a Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty. Squidward had a Krabby Patty whose buns were white as snow!♪"
Squidward, [talks while they sing the whole song again] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Where it's almost as if the evolutionary clock ticks backwards. [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick, ♪Squidward had a Krabby Patty--♪
Squidward, [SpongeBob & Patrick are still singing in the kitchen] Excuse me for just a second.
Patrick, ♪--white as snow!♪
Squidward," Do you mind, I'm trying to work in a fast food restaurant. You might wanna try it sometime!"
SpongeBob," I sure would, Squidward. That sounds... [Patrick interferes]"
Patrick," Oh, wait a minute! SpongeBob, you already do work in a fast food restaurant!"
SpongeBob," Oh, yeah!"
Patrick, Yay!
Squidward, Remind me to fire my therapist. [cuts to the front of Squidward's boat] And stop bringing your neighbors to work!
Patrick, We're not just neighbors.
SpongeBob, You can say that again!
Patrick, We're not just... [Squidward interferes]
Squidward," I don't care! [faces the customers, embarrassed. Laughs nervously] $4.19, please."
Patrick," Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!"
Squidward," [Squidward is shown like a thermometer, reaching the boiling point] Alright! I am gonna... Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but... [SpongeBob opens the door and bashes Squidward's face]"
SpongeBob, [singing] She'll be comin' around the Krabby Patty when she comes!
Squidward," [screams as SpongeBob looks into Squidward] SpongeBob, you nincompoop! You broke my face! Don't just stand there, help me! I need a doctor!"
SpongeBob," [gasps] Oh, doctor! Is he gonna be alright? For the love of Neptune, tell me!"
Doctorfish," Well ,son..."
SpongeBob, No! don't tell me! I can't take it! [SpongeBob is crying]
Doctorfish, We should know...
SpongeBob," No, please. Just... just don't."
Doctorfish, We won't know for two weeks. You'll just have to wait. [Purple Doctorfish leaves]
SpongeBob," Two weeks? I'll never make it. [SpongeBob falls down. Two weeks later, SpongeBob comes into the hospital with a bouquet of flowers]"
Rechid," Mornin', SpongeBob. You're early today."
SpongeBob," Good morning, Nurse Rechid. [walks over to an old lady] Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you. [takes out a blue flower and gives it to Mabel]"
Mabel," Oh, SpongeBob. Blue is my favorite color. Er... or is it orange?"
SpongeBob," [laughs] Don't worry, Mabel. I'll bet your amnesia's gonna wear off in no time. [walks away]"
Mabel, My what?
SpongeBob," [flops into Squidward's room] Hiya, Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back."
Squidward, [muffled shouting. His head is covered with bandages]
Doctorfish, We can't really have you in here today. I'm going to be removing Squidward's bandages and he made me swear to keep you far away from him.
SpongeBob," It has been two weeks already? [SpongeBob Smiling]. Don't worry, doc. I promise to stay out of the way."
Doctorfish, Okay. As long as you stay on the other side of the... [SpongeBob immediately dashes to the bed] [sighs] Right. [takes out some scissors and is about to remove the bandages on Squidward's face]
SpongeBob," Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait!"
Doctorfish, [angrily] What is it?
SpongeBob, Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera?
Doctorfish, I have no idea what that is. Please. Just let me work.
SpongeBob," Very well, doctor. Carry on."
Doctorfish, May I?
SpongeBob, Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation!
Doctorfish, That is a television set put here for the patient's enjoyment. And it's not even plugged into the wall!
SpongeBob," You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it!"
Doctorfish, Now what?!
Nurse," Doctor, we can't do this. Surely we can use a less dangerous procedure. After all, we have to start thinking about... the welfare of... [Purple Doctorfish turns off the TV]"
SpongeBob, Wait!
Doctorfish, [impatiently] WHAT could it possibly be this TIME?!
SpongeBob, I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before.
Doctorfish, [gasps] I... I... I can't believe it. [Purple Doctorfish faints]
Squidward, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, Yeah?
Squidward, How does it look?
SpongeBob, [looks at Squidward's face and is likewise stunned] Great Neptune...
Squidward, Come on. Spit it out. I can take it.
Nurse," Time for your medicine, Mister... [sees Squidward's new look] Mister... Mister... [flirting gesture] Handsome! Ohhh... [The nurse melts]"
Squidward, What did she call me?
SpongeBob, Handsome. But she spelled it wrong.
Squidward," Quick, hand me that mirror! [SpongeBob hands him a mirror, and he notices his new handsome look] What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I am handsome!"
SpongeBob," Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk!"
Marge, So handsome! [faints]
Thaddeus, Handsome! [Then more women faint]
Billy," [Crash!] Hello, Handsome."
SpongeBob," Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before."
Tina, [screams] So handsome!
SpongeBob, If that's even possible.
chair," Uh... [screams, then starts walking] It's a miracle... I can walk."
Harold, [takes off sunglasses] I can see!
Fish, I can fly! [goes on top of a building and starts to fly] Uh-oh. My shoe's untied. [his shoe falls off]
Fish," Mr. Handsome, can I have your autograph? No! Not in the book, on my retainer."
Squidward, A limousine?! [shocked then the crowd cheers]
Squidward," Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery. [Limo stops at Squidward's house while the crowd cheers for them]"
SpongeBob," Well, I'm gonna go clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome."
Squidward," Oh, don't worry."
Crowd, [cheers] Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! [night time and crowd still keeps on cheering for Squidward until dawn]
Squidward," Huh? Well, better go greet the commoners.[heads outside to receive the cheering crowd, and is stunned to see numerous citizens surrounding him]"
Crowd, Handsome! Handsome! Handsome!
Squidward," Good morning my people! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but even I [laughs] strange as it seems, need my beauty sleep."
Squidward," I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger. [plays the clarinet]"
Bill, Hey what is that sound?
Harold, Wait it's him! The handsome man! [crowd cheers]
Squidward," Beautiful and talented. what more do they want? Don't worry folks, there's more where that came from... Hey! [a guy steals his clarinet]"
Thaddeus, I got the clarinet! [crowd rips the shirt off the fish who got Squidward's clarinet and breaks his clarinet]
Squidward," [smells the liquid soap] There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure. [a female fish takes his soap] Hey, my grandmother gave me that soap! Well, no one ever said it'd be easy being so handsome, Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to.. [screams as a big female fish with 4 eyes pops out of his bath tub]"
Fish," Hi, Handsome."
Squidward, [screams and jumps out of the window and goes to SpongeBob's house while SpongeBob is clipping his toenails] SpongeBob! You gotta help me! They stole my bubble bath! Public life ain't all it's cracked up to be. I want my old life back.
SpongeBob, Hmmm... I know just what to do. [crowd chases Squidward and SpongeBob until they reach the Krusty Krab]
Krabs," Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person, everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward."
Squidward, We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back.
Krabs, And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3.
Squidward," Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back!"
SpongeBob," I can't! It was one thing doing it by accident, but I can't hurt you on purpose."
Squidward, You better hurt me or I'm really gonna hurt you!
SpongeBob," Well, okay..."
Squidward," Now don't hold back, SpongeBob. Just really let me have it."
SpongeBob," Just remember, Squidward, this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you."
Squidward," Uhhh... okay, just let me just memori... [SpongeBob slams the door on Squidward's face] Dooowww! Hey, I wasn't ready. [slam!] Would you mind waiting ‘til I... [slam!]"
SpongeBob," Hang on, you're starting to look like your old self again. [slam!] Nope. Still too handsome. [slam!] It's still not working. Maybe I'm not doing it hard enough. [slam!]"
Squidward, Sponge... hang on a sec... [SpongeBob slams the door on him over and over again] let me... uhhh... [Squidward becomes even more handsome]
SpongeBob," Eeee! Squidward, you're even more handsome now! [crowd cheers even louder] And the crowd is in a frenzy."
Squidward," Well, SpongeBob, it was you who got me into this mess, now you have to get me out again!"
SpongeBob," I know, Squidward! I'll think of something! Huh! I just need, I just... [a shoe from outside will be hitting Squidward]"
Squidward, [In slow motion] Got me into...
SpongeBob, [springs into action] Squidward! Look out for that falling shoe!
Squidward," Huh? [SpongeBob pushes Squidward; Squidward screams while he is dramatically flying to the pole. The scene briefly cuts to SpongeBob, who gets hit by the shoe and has no feeling. After a while, Squidward hits the pole.]"
SpongeBob, Squidward...
Squidward, [his face returns to normal] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob," You're back! Oh, Squidward... I love you no matter how many times we smash your face."
Squidward, I almost wish that meant something. [crowd leaves after seeing Squidward not handsome anymore]
Krabs," Hey, where you going? Don't leave me! Please! I'm beggin' ya! Look. I can make him handsome again. Watch! [slams the door on Squidward's face repeatedly] See? [slam!] He's getting handsome. It just takes a little [slam!] effort, just a little [slam!] elbow grease. Please! Come back!"
SpongeBob, [sweeping]
Krabs, [moving his hands around over a table with a banner above it]
SpongeBob," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
Krabs," Huh? [turns his head to see who was talking to him] Oh. Ahoy, SpongeBob!"
SpongeBob," Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!"
Krabs," Okay, that's over with, Now why don't you go see if First Mate Squidward needs any help at the register?"
SpongeBob," And what are you up to on this fine, fine Monday?"
Krabs," Well, I was gonna wait til this afternoon, but I guess I could show you now."
SpongeBob, Show me what?
Krabs, I'm introducing a new Krusty Krab promotion.
SpongeBob, Ah! You are?!
Krabs," I sure am. [starts to walk away. Here, the banner above the table is revealed to say, New Krusty Krab Promotion. On the table, there are three cups]"
SpongeBob, Who are ya gonna introduce it to?
Krabs," Well, all my loyal customers, of course!"
Squidward, Ha!
Krabs," [glares at Squidward] Anyway, we got new beverage cups."
SpongeBob, Wow.
Krabs," [pointing to the cups] There's Regular, Large, and the new Viking Size!"
SpongeBob," But, Mr. Krabs, these are all the same size cup."
Krabs," SpongeBob, this promotion is designed to save us money. Now, don't forget. Each participating patron who purchases any drink in our new Krusty Krab Viking Size cup gets to a chance to try on this genuine cardboard Viking helmet. [holds up a cardboard helmet that is taped and has three fake emeralds taped to it]"
Squidward, That he found while cleaning out his attic over the weekend.
Krabs, Don't you know when you're being ignored?
Squidward, You're the only one talking.
SpongeBob, [staring at the Viking helmet] Mr. Krabs... [reaches out to take the helmet] it's beautifu-
Krabs, Not so fast! Access to the mighty helmet will be granted to active promotion participants only. And only those who purchase Viking Size.
SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, what's a Viking?"
Krabs," Oh, well, uh... the Vikings lived a long time ago."
SpongeBob, How long?
Krabs," Oh, I, uh, about ten years."
SpongeBob, And?
Krabs, Uh... [walks to his office] You're gonna have to ask Squidward any more questions ya got. He's the smart one. [closes his office door]
Squidward, Barnacle butt.
SpongeBob," [appears next to Squidward] Hi, Squidward!"
Squidward, Ay! What do you want?
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs said you were gonna teach me all about the Vikings.
Squidward, Oh really?
SpongeBob," Will ya teach me, huh?!"
Squidward, Sure! I'll teach ya. Listen closely now. The Vikings were...
Vikings," [standing, some with weapons]"
Squidward, a race of scholars and scientists who lived before even Mr. Krabs was born.

Squidward, They are believed to have discovered ketchup...

Squidward, Their favorite movies are in black and white.
screen, [appears]
Viking, Look out!
Squidward, And grown Vikings are known to collect socks which they display and trade at monthly sock trading conventions called Sock'n Garten.
Vikings, Sock'n Garten.
SpongeBob, Whoa....
Squidward, [goes back to reading his magazine]
SpongeBob," Squidward, do you think Vikings really drink their beverages in Viking Size?"
Squidward," [sarcastically, but enthusiastically] Of course they do! How else Mr. Krabs come up with such a brilliant idea?"
SpongeBob, Do you think that-
Squidward, SpongeBob! Can't you see I am trying to work?
SpongeBob, But-
Squidward, [annoyed] But what?!
SpongeBob, There's so much more about Vikings that I wanna find out.
Squidward," [now angry] Well, then why don't you go ask them?!"
SpongeBob," [Gasp!] Thanks, Squidward! [kisses Squidward on the head]"
SpongeBob," [returns to the kitchen. While flipping Krabby Patties, he reads a letter as he writes it] Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff. [Now, he is shown walking to a mailbox with his mouth closed, but you can still hear his voice] If you would take the time to [puts the letter in the mailbox] answer all my neat questions, [starts to walk away] then that would be [walks back to the mailbox and puts the red flag up] really swell."
King," [on his throne, between two female Vikings] Ah, Helga. Tell me once again of the time ye visited those remote Himalayan hot springs."
Viking," [crawls through the door of the palace, out of breath and filthy] A letter. [goes unconscious and drops the envelope]"
King, [angry and banging his fists] Why must you always come in here during story time?!
Viking," But... but, I-"
King, Guards!
Viking, Please! No! You don't understand! I was only trying to... eh...
Helga," Your Majesty, look! [picks up the envelope off the ground] A letter."
King, How incredibly interesting! I must read it at once.
Squidward," [bored, and still reading his magazine] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?"
Viking, We're Vikings. Our chief has sent us here because [holds up SpongeBob's letter] we've got this letter.
Squidward," SpongeBob, there's some Vikings here to see you."
SpongeBob," What's that, Squidward? I couldn't here ya. I was... ooh."
Viking, Ah.. are you the one they call the SpongeBob?
SpongeBob," Uh, I think so."
Viking," Well, we are here to teach ya all about the Vikings"
SpongeBob, Huzzah!
Viking, One of the things Vikings like to do is... redecorate.
SpongeBob, How interesting.
Viking," [there is fire everywhere] And another thing ve Vikings like to do is appropriate. [pulls on the cash register until the wires snap, and throws it on the ship]"
SpongeBob, What a fascinating culture.
Viking," And on occasion,... the Vikings... [pulls out a rope] ve've been known to liberate. [ties Squidward up with the rope]"
Squidward, What the?! Hey! You can't do [gets thrown onto the ship] [screams] tha!
SpongeBob, [tied up by a rope] I can't believe how much I'm learning.
Krabs," Squidward, I'll be back in one hour. I'm going on my lunch break. [sees the fire] Squidward?"
Squidward, Would you mind telling us what this is all about?
Viking," [spitting] Shes. [P.S. He started to say sure, but changed to yes] Now that you're part of our crew,... I guess we should introduce ourselves. [punches a Viking on the chest] This is Olaf. [slaps a Viking on the chest] And this is Olaf. [points to a Viking] And this is Olaf. [points to a Viking] This... is Olaf, Olaf, Olaf, Olaf, And... um... [covers his eyes and snaps his fingers]"
Viking, Olaf.
Viking, Olaf.
Squidward," So, let me guess. Your name must be..."
Viking, That's right. Gordon.
SpongeBob, Nice to meet ya.
Gordon," Now. Before I put you two to werk, I wanna know what..."
SpongeBob, Wait! I still have lots more questions about the Vikings' way of life.
Gordon, Like what?
SpongeBob," Well, like... what do the Vikings like to do for fun?"
Gordon," Hm... fun. Um, um, um, uh, well,..."
Olaf, What about the Shield Toss?
Gordon," Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. [grabs a shield and throws it at a door]"
SpongeBob, Anything else?
Gordon, Um...
Olaf, Oh! What about Flaming Shield Toss?
Gordon," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [grabs another shield, lights it on fire with a torch, and throws it at the door]"
Olafs, [clap]
SpongeBob, Anything else?
Vikings, [think]
Gordon," Eh, I, I, I can't really think of anything."
Olaf," Me neither. Oh, yeah!"
Gordon," What is it, Olaf?"
Olaf, We like to sing songs.
Olaf, Ooh... No we don't!
Olaf," [being carried away] Wait! No! Okay, I admit it was a lousy idea! I promise it won't happen again! [gets thrown into a catapult]"
Gordon, You got that right.
Olaf," [gets launched by the catapult. He screams, and splashes into the ocean]"
Gordon, Any other questions?
SpongeBob, [stunned] I'll let you know if I think of anything.
Gordon, So. Tell me. Vhat is it that you two know how to do?
SpongeBob," Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula."
Squidward, Ha.
Gordon, Quiet. You're our ship's new head chef. And... vhat can you do?
Squidward," Well, if you must know, I'm a widely renowned clarinet virtuoso, state-recognized interior design consultant, licensed and board certified antique macrame conosuor, born and raised collector and sculptor of driftwood, and able to recognize over 13 hundred brand names of single-personed pedal operate vehicles at a single glance. Plus, I make a killer Soufflé."
Gordon, Impressive. You'll be the ship's bathroom attendant.
SpongeBob," A Promotion. Congratulations, Squidward!"
Squidward," [appears in front of Gordon] Hold it right there, whiskers! Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place! Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get?! Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto! [appears in the catapult] On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!"
SpongeBob, Wait! [stops the hammer] You can't do that.
Gordon, You mean to question the vill of the tribe?
SpongeBob," If it means saving my best friend, then yes."
Gordon, [throws an axe in front of SpongeBob] Well. Then pick up the weapon and fight with me a duel in accordance with the prophecy! [pulls a sword out of no where]
Olafs," Duel, duel, duel, duel!"
Gordon, Go on. Pick it up!
SpongeBob, But.... [struggles to pick up the ax]
Gordon, Go on. Veakling.
Olaf, Heh! Owned!
SpongeBob," But, but I..."
Olaf," We're being attacked by a giant monster. This is the end, uh, the end, uh, of the Vikings!"
Olaf," Oh, Vahalla. Why have you forsaken us?"
SpongeBob," Guys, you just ran into a piece of ice. No one's forsaken you. There's a breach in the hull over there. You just gotta patch it up."
Gordon, [pulls out a blanket] Quick! Everybody take one of these!
SpongeBob, What's that for?
Gordon, It's a security blanket.
SpongeBob," But, how ya gonna patch up a leak with that?"
Gordon, We're not. But it makes us feel so much better.
Gordon, Wait! You forgot yer blanket!
Squidward, [still tied up in the catapult] What the barnacles is going on down there?
SpongeBob," Pardon me, Squidward! [breaks the rope that was tying Squidward with his spatula]"
Squidward, [sliding down the catapult] It's all yours.
SpongeBob, Thanks. [lassos a mast and the catapult turns] There.
Olaf, Look up there! What's he doing?
SpongeBob," Here goes nothing! [throws his spatula at the pedal. The catapult launches him into the breech in the hull.. The ship straightens up, the vikings cheer]"
SpongeBob, Now that's what I call a Viking-sized adventure!
SpongeBob," ♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo! [uses spatula as drum sticks] ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done. [flips all the patties into the air then uses one of his special helmet gadgets to squirt ketchup and mustard on the patties. When the patties fall, they land on a bun that SpongeBob is holding. He then deals out the lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes as if they were cards to the six patties] In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen such a lovely group of patties. Especially— you. [points to a patty with lettuce for hair, tomatoes for eyes, a pickle for a nose, ketchup for rosy cheeks and mustard for a smile] Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?"
Squidward," SpongeBob, I need that order of six."
SpongeBob," Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six. [only gives Squidward five patties] That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. [laughs]"
Squidward, Uh— yeah.
SpongeBob," Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: ""That which is fried, must be eaten."""
Squidward," SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is. [takes the patty to the table. SpongeBob looks out the kitchen door to see three muscular guys sitting at the table, in which two of them are eating patties while the other one doesn't have one]"
Squidward," Right here, muscleboy."
SpongeBob," [screams and grabs the patty] No, I won't let you do this to Patty."
Squidward," SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby—"
SpongeBob," [sitting under the grill] Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved. [opens up the patty] Amazing."
Squidward," [snickering] What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? [continues snickering]"
SpongeBob, Great idea. [runs off]
Squidward, [sighs] I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
SpongeBob," [gives a Krabby Patty to Muscular Guy #1] Enjoy, sir."
SpongeBob," What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us. [small explosion] Fire! [alarm bell rings. SpongeBob pants] Fire! Fire!"
Gary, [by a fire extinguisher] Meow. [puts out the fire. SpongeBob stops panting]
SpongeBob," It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now. [doorbell rings] Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. [opens the door]"
Patrick," [lifts SpongeBob up] SpongeBob, how about another game of— [ties SpongeBob in a knot] tie your best buddy in knots. [lies down] My turn."
SpongeBob," Sorry, Patrick. [unties himself] I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out."
Sandy," Hi-yah! [karate chops door open] Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?"
SpongeBob," Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready."
Sandy," Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for beboppin' all over Timbuktu."
SpongeBob," [sighs] Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that. [walks away] Patty and I have to be on our way."
Patrick," I've been replaced by a sandwich! [sobs] Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob. [walks away. cut to SpongeBob dancing with his patty and singing]"
SpongeBob," ♪Oh, baby, They may call me a fool, But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat, Ba-ay-ay-by!♪ [they feed the scallops some bread] ♪When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue.♪ Whoo! ♪Oh, baby! There isn't anything.

Ba-ay-ay-by! Your looks are sweeter than honey. From your pickles to your buns, It ain't even funny—!♪ [they fall off of a waterfall and into the river. Races for the patty] I'm coming for you! [he lifts her sunhat in which floats in the water and all her ingredients are spilled everywhere] Oh, no! Look at you! Don't worry, Patty! I'll take care of this! [he puts her back together but the patty is soggy] There you go! ♪All better. Oh, baby.♪ [cut to SpongeBob and Patty on a picnic. Patty has become rotten] Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. [cut to the Krusty Krab at an early evening with a vibrant pink sunset]"
Krabs, Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Squidward, How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?
Krabs, Well— actually— [doors open to SpongeBob in a tux]
SpongeBob," Good day, sir."
Squidward, As if on cue.
Krabs," SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?"
SpongeBob," Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date."
Krabs," A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady? [quietly] By the way, is she rich?"
SpongeBob, She's rich in taste.
Squidward," How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind. [limousine arrives]"
Krabs," Ooh, a limousine."
SpongeBob, There she is.
Krabs," Oh, I can smell the money already."
SpongeBob," [carrying in Patty] Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town. [walks by a couple eating and they sniff the odor in the air]"
Smith," Harold, again?"
Smith," Martha, I know what you're thinking. It's not me this time."
Smith," Well, whatever it is, it's disgusting."
Smith, Let's get out of here. [they walk away]
Smith, Yuck.
SpongeBob," Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty."
Krabs, Your date's a...Krabby Patty? [to Squidward] Methinks the boy's really lost it.
Squidward, [sniffs the odor and wafts the air] What's that putrid odor?
Krabs," [sniffs] Oh, it's that Krabby Patty. [the patty is messy as a foghorn blows] What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?"
SpongeBob," This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty. [quietly] And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the ""manager's treatment,"" do you?"
Krabs," Sorry, boy. no can do."
SpongeBob," Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. [shows a $5 bill]"
Krabs, What was that? I couldn't hear you.
SpongeBob, [gets out more money] How about now?
Krabs," All right, take a seat. [takes the money]"
SpongeBob," Grrrrrazie! [gets out a tiny throne seat for Patty] Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen. [Squidward shows up. Speaks with a French accent] Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?"
Squidward," Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods— why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint."
SpongeBob," Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie."
Squidward, I'll show you sick. [grabs the patty]
SpongeBob," Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?"
Squidward," Beautiful, huh?! How beautiful do you think this is?! [patty has maggots in it and is gross]"
SpongeBob," [takes patty from Squidward] Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea."
Squidward," Well, I definitely see I can't help the mentally atrophied. Goodbye, Creature."
SpongeBob," Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you— [sniffs] Yeah, what is that smell? [gasps] Patty? [the patty looks the same way it was before when SpongeBob showed Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Screams as he drops the Krabby Patty on the table] What's happened to you?!"
Krabs," I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does. [rotten tomatoes fall out of the patty] Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?"
SpongeBob," Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs."
Krabs, Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
SpongeBob," I see now. I see what I must do. [jumps up on the table] Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love! [the sickness rumbles. Eats it]"
Krabs," Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25¢ for the patty. Employee discount."
SpongeBob, [gags] Can I get a doggie bag with that?
SpongeBob," You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place. [squirts soap on his head and scrubs the mirror clean, then puts his work hat on his head from his nose] Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words. [gets a mop and a bucket] Now to attack these floors!"
Krabs," [in his office, on the phone, chuckling] Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!"
SpongeBob, [chuckles] Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates. [turns to reveal an ear on his back]
Krabs, And he's been with me for such a long time now.
SpongeBob, [chuckles again] I am.
Krabs, But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.
SpongeBob," Yep, he's gonna have to-- [notices, shocked] What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or... [gasps] Squidward! [SpongeBob stands behind Squidward, who is sitting down] Phew! I am taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!"
Squidward," [stands up] No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. [walks away]"
SpongeBob," Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement. [stands right next to Squidward in the workstation]"
Squidward, What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob," Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy... [makes himself taller, like a skyscraper] ...and it looks like it is you!"
Squidward," No, I'm not! [walks away]"
SpongeBob," Squidward, wait! [becomes short again] We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet! [extends his legs]"
Squidward, [off-screen] I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!
SpongeBob," You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa! [walks off balance, then falls and breaks a table] Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts. [makes a strange face] Face the facts that I'm the little guy! [tears up, making another face] And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today."
Squidward, [smiles] Krabs is letting you go today? [laughs] As in I won't have to work with you ever again. [laughs]
SpongeBob," [walks through the doors and becomes flattened, sad] Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it. [the wind blows SpongeBob away]"
Krabs," [still on the phone] Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go. [a little scallop in a cage is shown] Gotten too big for his cage. [releases the scallop] Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed."
Gary, [meows questioningly]
SpongeBob," Oh, what's the use, Gary? [his body pops up to his normal self] I've lost the will to go on! [bursts into tears on the couch, then stops, noticing a rumble from a refrigerator Patrick is pulling with a rope] [sniffs sadly] Hi, Patrick."
Patrick," Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob. [happily] I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again."
SpongeBob, [confused] What happened to yours?
Patrick," Nothing, it's just empty."
SpongeBob," [sad] Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator."
Patrick," Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me."
SpongeBob," Oh, no, I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, [sniffles] or Gary, [sniffles again] or for anybody!"
Patrick," [shocked] Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!"
SpongeBob, [sad] I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.
Patrick," [gets an idea, happily] I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when I'm looking for a job. [runs to the couch, then sits on it] Kick back, watch some TV, [turns the TV on with his remote, then holds a carton of Drinkable Sausage with a close-up shot of it] and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage! [drinks from the carton]"
Gary, [meows while sitting on some newspaper]
SpongeBob," [happily] Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds. [picks up one newspaper while noticing its dirty smell] Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones. [bubble transition to SpongeBob reading a clean newspaper] Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. Bank Teller Needed. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking. [bubble transition to SpongeBob counting money at a bank while having his name tag on] 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97. [flips money up with his spatula, then chops it all up, some flying onto Fred's head, forming the money into a Krabby Patty, as seen in a close-up shot of it] Order up! [rings the bell once, then employee takes SpongeBob's name tag off, causing SpongeBob to lose air inside of him] [bubble transition to SpongeBob hammering a nail while building a house] What do you think, boss?"
Carpenter," [looks at his house, shocked] Clam shells! What have you done, boy? [looks at a piece of paper showing what the real house looks like, while then looking at a house built by SpongeBob shaped into a Krabby Patty] I told you to build me a house, not a sandwich! [kicks SpongeBob and Patrick out of the construction site]"
SpongeBob," I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick. [walks in front of a billboard showing a live sponge] I need to start fresh. [some words on the billboard sparkle as SpongeBob talks] With a job that feels... natural. Something that says, ""This is a job for a sponge."" Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?"
Patrick," No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!"
SpongeBob," I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?"
Patrick, Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.
SpongeBob," That's just a billboard, Patrick."
Patrick, Why don't you get a job as a billboard?
SpongeBob," I...don't think that's physically possible, [happily] but I could audition to be a sponge model."
Patrick," Fine, do it your way."
SpongeBob," Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent."
Patrick," Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?"
SpongeBob," Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?"
Patrick, Why don't you find out?
SpongeBob," [quickly covers the door] Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. [starts walking out, but Patrick stops him]"
Patrick," No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore. This is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries! [pushes SpongeBob through the door to a lady fish, a casting director, looking at a clipboard] [to casting director] My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role."
SpongeBob," Oh, well, want is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it. [to Patrick] I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick."
Director," [stops SpongeBob and Patrick from walking out] Hold it. You want the audition, kid? You got it."
SpongeBob," [turns his whole body around, happily] I did?"
Director, Show me what you got.
SpongeBob," [sweats, worried] Okay. Here goes. [clears throat] Patrick, please? [Patrick hands out a metal tool and hits it on his forehead, playing a note] ♪ Laaa! ♪ [clears throat again] Sorry. [keeps clearing throat and getting a perfect pitch at the same time, from high to low]"
Director," Okay, okay, okay! Let's get on with this train wreck."
SpongeBob," Okay, getting on it. [clears throat yet again, then sings off-key] ♪ When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim! ♪"
Director," [unenthusiastically] All right, all right. Thank you. I've heard enough."
SpongeBob, [runs closely to the casting director] How'd I do?
Director," Horribly. I've seen clams with more talent than you. [SpongeBob falls down] But since the role specifically calls for a real sponge, the part is yours. [SpongeBob slowly gets up] Here's the script. We start shooting tomorrow at 10. Don't be late. [SpongeBob rips himself in half, happily snatches the script, then jumps out of the building]"
SpongeBob," I guess a sponge can make it in this town. [his pupils turn into stars] I am going to be a star! [a crowd suddenly comes close to SpongeBob, cheering while holding camera and microphones, while a news reporter faces a camera close to SpongeBob]"
Barbara," I'm standing here with the new face of television, Mr. SpongeBob SquarePants. [to SpongeBob] I'm sure the viewing audience would love to know, how does it feel to be the next big thing?"
SpongeBob," Fantastic. [puts on sunglasses, then signs an autograph and waves at the crowd chanting, ""SpongeBob! SpongeBob!""]"
Patrick," SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?"
SpongeBob," Oh, yes, I did, Patrick. [points to himself] I said, ""You're looking at the new face of television."""
Patrick, All right!
SpongeBob," Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep."
Patrick," Yeah, beauty sleep!"
SpongeBob, That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.
Krabs," [walks by, carrying golf supplies and even wearing golf clothes] Afternoon, boy-o!"
SpongeBob," Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you. [he and Patrick walk by]"
Krabs," [scratches his head] What was that about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual. [walks away]"
SpongeBob," Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television. [walks into his house]"
Director," Oh, you're back!"
SpongeBob, A star's first day is his most important.
Director," Great. Let me see if they're ready on set. [through a microphone] SpongeBob's here, sir. Uh-huh. Okay, great. [to SpongeBob] Okay, you can go right in."
SpongeBob," Yippee! [happily runs into the set, toward a spotlight] I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director."
Director," [with a French accent] Very well. [through a megaphone] Lose the pants! [a claw snatches SpongeBob's pants, making him naked] Hans! Where's my star?! [a live-action hand comes out of a dressing room and grabs SpongeBob]"
SpongeBob," Whoa! What's happening? [lights turn on behind SpongeBob, showing a dirty bathroom set] Wh-wh-what's happening?!"
Director," In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures."
SpongeBob," Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?"
Director, [mumbles angrily and quietly] Don't you get it? You are the cleaning utensil. [SpongeBob suddenly frowns] Roll speed! [a red light turns on from a camera]
Charlie," [as a movie assistant, holding a movie clipboard] New Sponge Commercial: Take one. [closes clipboard]"
Director, [through a megaphone] Action!
Announcer," [off-screen] Oh, no! Your bathroom is a disaster. Get it cleaned up fast with...the new sponge! [while on camera, SpongeBob groans] Household chores are a snap with new sponge. It cleans sinks. [sink shines after being cleaned by a now dirty SpongeBob] Just look at that shine! New sponge cuts through even the toughest grime and grit. New sponge also cleans showers! [SpongeBob screams while cleaning the shower, which shines too] Ha, ha! That tile looks good as new! [SpongeBob sighs, tired] But best of all, new sponge can make any toilet sparkle! [as SpongeBob hears this, he looks at the toilet dirty inside before going straight in]"
SpongeBob, Noooo! [suddenly stops right before he goes in] I can't do this!
Director, [through a megaphone] Cut!
SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.
Director, Was? You said you were professional actor.
SpongeBob," Well, I'm not. [puts on his work hat] I am a fry cook. [holds up his spatula] That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. [walks away]"
Director, Wait! Wait!
Krabs, Ever so gently...
SpongeBob," [slams door loudly, causing Mr. Krabs' money pyramid to fall down] Mr. Krabs! [while crying a trail of tears toward Mr. Krabs] Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better. [hugs Mr. Krabs] Please."
Krabs," Boy, what are you going on about?!"
SpongeBob," [sniffles] I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go."
Krabs," All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition. [SpongeBob happily nods]"
SpongeBob," Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!"
Hans," Hey, could you keep it down in there? [shown reading a newspaper in a stall while on a toilet] I'm trying to concentrate."
Patrick, [walking] So why are we going to Sandy's house?
SpongeBob, To see her vacation slides for the hu.. [gets smacked in face by door] Ow!
Agent," [Walking out the door with his partner and the slides] We got the slides, sir."
Patrick, Who?...What?...Why?
Sandy," [Taking SpongeBob and Patrick] Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think... [She pulls a tree trunk lever to activate a secret hideout] You see, [puts the two on two chairs. She goes to a copy of the vacation slides] Someone already made six copies."
Sandy," Yes, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob, Who is this someone? Do we know him?
Sandy," By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob. [Patrick raises his hand] Yes, Patrick?"
Patrick, Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
Sandy," [tying up SpongeBob and Patrick with rope] Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay? [they nod in agreement] Good. [shows the first slide] The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation. [switches to the next slide] And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute. [shows the next slide] And this... [dreadfully] This is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit. "
SpongeBob," [walking to Sandy's house] ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy [spinning] I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪ [rings the doorbell; suddenly, an extreme humming noise vibrates the ocean floor] Sandy...! [a rocket emerges from beneath the ground] Whoa!"
Sandy, What do you think of my moon wagon?
SpongeBob," Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?"
Sandy," Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a ""coincidence."" I'm getting ready for my vacation!"
SpongeBob, Where are you going?
Sandy, The moon! [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob, You're going on a moon trip?!
Sandy, Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…
SpongeBob, I'll be right back!
Sandy, ...load up the moon wagon? [sighs]
SpongeBob," [SpongeBob is at bakery] Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. [attempts to pull a ticket, but fails and gets tangled up]"
Bakerman, Number 12.
SpongeBob," Yes, I'm Number 12!"
Bakerman, What can I get for you today?
SpongeBob," I need a bon voyage sheet cake. [Bakerman brings out out sheet cake] Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! ""Have fun on the moon..."". What rhymes with ""moon""? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?"
Bakerman, How about “loon?”
SpongeBob," I got it! ""See you soon!”"
Countdown," [SpongeBob heads back to Sandy’s dome with the cake. The rocket is a few seconds from takeoff] T-minus 12, 11, 10, 9, 8…"
SpongeBob," No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake! [grabs a hold of the ladder, but falls into the rocket] Whoa!"
Sandy, [sees SpongeBob] SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?
SpongeBob," [panting, and out of breath] I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and…"
Countdown, Launch commencing.
Sandy, Never mind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!
SpongeBob," I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip! [rocket takes off] Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy..."
Sandy," Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight."
SpongeBob," Oh, I just wanted to show you the…"
Sandy," for the afterburners! [activates afterburners; propels rocket further] What were you saying, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob," Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake."
Sandy, You can't bring regular food into space!
SpongeBob," Wha, wha, wha, why not?"
Sandy," Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!"
SpongeBob, Oh. Is that a bad thing?
Sandy, Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. [cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off] Ah nuts!
SpongeBob," Oops. Sorry, Sandy."
Sandy," [presses ""Toss"" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit] Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks. [goes into space] Aha! There's our problem. [clears the cake out from the the reverse spatial linearity drive.] Eh, could've used more nuts. [comes back inside rocket] Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?"
SpongeBob, Roger that! Folding hands.
Sandy," Now, get ready for lunar module se…"
SpongeBob, [folds hands into a bird] What do you think Sandy?
Sandy, Just don't touch anything while we separate.
SpongeBob, Ok.
Sandy," [detaches rocket from boosters] That looks like a good spot. [lands on the moon, sets camp up] Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! [brings out boards]"
SpongeBob, What's moon crater boarding?
Sandy," You ride these on that like this. [jumps on and rides her snowboard on the moon] Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah. [flips her board in midair] Right there is the classic Texas tail grab. [grabs tail, and twists it into the shape of Texas] And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop. [spins and breaks an asteroid into an acorn and eats it] Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour de Saturn. [lies down on Saturn's rings] Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn."
SpongeBob, Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
Sandy," Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn."
SpongeBob," I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. [jumps on board and floats off into space] Sandy, this doesn't seem right."
Sandy," Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! [lassos asteroid to SpongeBob]"
SpongeBob," [grabs onto asteroid] Ok. [the rock pulls SpongeBob to the moon surface. SpongeBob begins to surf the moon, but screams]"
Sandy," Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick? [SpongeBob keeps screaming] Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”"
SpongeBob," [SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite] Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]"
Billy," [shifts to Patrick watching TV] Carol, your real father is… [TV goes out due to satellite damage]"
Patrick, Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
SpongeBob," [scene returns to SpongeBob] Watch this Sandy! [ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down] Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… [accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak] puncture into the side of the rocket."
Sandy," You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the ""no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”"
SpongeBob, Oops!
Sandy," Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!"
SpongeBob," Wait! I have to do something very important! [takes picture of himself “holding the earth”] There! [both go into the rocket, and head for earth] So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?"
Sandy," If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. [rocket fuel signs shows “Empty”. Rocket starts falling to earth] Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!"
SpongeBob, Is that bad?
Sandy, [unbuckles seatbelt] Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”.
SpongeBob," Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?! [unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall] Sandy, where are you going?"
Sandy, 'm going to take this bull by the horns! [Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth]
SpongeBob, Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
Sandy, Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. [the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror] Yeehaw!
SpongeBob, [continues screaming] My goodness!
Sandy, Yeehaw! Yeehaw! [rockets crashes]
SpongeBob," Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? [Sandy groans] Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation."
Sandy," Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes."
them, [laugh]
Squidward," Maybe I'll do a cute little button. [pulls his nose to give himself a button-nose. His nose pops out suddenly.] Or something a bit more manly perhaps. [pulls his nose hairs to create a mustache and a humanoid nose. His nose pops out back to normal suddenly] Upturned might be good, too. [breathes in, puts his thumb into his mouth, and then blows. He gets an upturned nose. Just then, SpongeBob appears in his unicycle.]"
SpongeBob," Hi, Squidward."
Squidward, Great. [slaps himself] The idiot found me.
SpongeBob, Whatcha doing?
Squidward, I'm picking a nose.
SpongeBob," Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out."
Squidward," I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with."
SpongeBob," [gasps] But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a... [freaks out when he sees how hideously disgusting Squidward's nose is up close] Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?"
Squidward, With you? Absolutely not.
SpongeBob," Aww, come on, Squidward. [pedals off and comes back with a trashcan attached to his unicycle] I can get you there lickety-split."
Nurse," You can't dump your garbage here, sir."
SpongeBob," Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in."
Nurse," Holy nostroly! You must be here for the nose job. Let's, uh, get your paperwork filled out."
Surgeon," You just relax, sir. The doctor will be ready for you soon."
Squidward, [inhales deeply] Ah. This is nice.
SpongeBob," Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home."
Narrator, Five minutes later...
Squidward," [grunts as he pops out of his pile of teddy bears] SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!"
SpongeBob," Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help."
Bear, I love you.
Squidward, [grunts as he rips the teddy off of him] The bed is fine!
SpongeBob, Fluff your pillow?
Squidward, No.
SpongeBob, Fluff your IV bag?
Squidward," Enough, you buffoon!"
SpongeBob," Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful."
Squidward," [sighs] If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture."
SpongeBob," Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve."
SpongeBob," Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—"
Nurse, Grab a uniform out of the closet.
SpongeBob," Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo! [runs into the closet and comes back out with a uniform] Ooh! Candy stripes. [slurps on the strips] Strawberry."
Doctor," Ah, Doctor, thank goodness you're here."
Doctor, We were just looking for another physician to join us on our rounds.
Doctor, And what seems to be the problem today?
Catfish, [coughing] My throat hurts.
Doctor," Prescribe him a numbing throat spray. Let's move on, shall we?"
SpongeBob," Wait a second! I think I've seen this before. [rubs his finger all over the catfish and abstracts some filth] Mm, yeah. [licks the filth] Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken."
Catfish," Hey, my keys. And my throat feels better."
SpongeBob," You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time. [grunts as he pulls out a pen, pencil and paintbrush from his head] Mm-hmm. [picks a pen and writes something down on a paper] Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys."
Catfish," Thanks, doc."
SpongeBob," No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help."
Doctor," What treatment might you prescribe for this next patient, Doctor?"
Runner, So what do you think? Will I be able to run in the Bikini Bottom marathon next week?
Doctor," Oh, my, no. I'm afraid you're—"
SpongeBob, Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time. [looks around and sees a skeleton] Ah!
Runner, What are you—
Doctor, Most unorthodox.
Doctor, He's a genius.
Runner," Thanks, doc."
SpongeBob," Ready, set. [blows blowhorn as the runner runs out backwards]"
Doctor," And what seems to be your problem today, ma'am?"
Puff," Sometimes, I just don't have it in me to puff up under my own power."
SpongeBob," Hi, Mrs. Puff."
Puff, No! Not you! [whimpers] What are you doing here?
SpongeBob," [whispers] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine. [climbs through the iron lung]"
Doctor, You're kidding of course. We've placed her in an iron lung to help puff her back up.
SpongeBob, Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes. [imitates airplane]
Puff, Huh?
Puff, [whispers] Help me! [screams]
doctor, Hey!
Runner, My legs!
SpongeBob," Never fear, Mrs. Puff. I haven't lost a patient all day. [puts on medical goggles] Let's get medical."
SpongeBob," Oh, no."
Puff," Oh. Actually, I feel like my old self again. But you still don't get a driver's license. [shrinks down to normal size and falls to the ground] Oh!"
Doctor, Wow. I've never seen anyone work an iron lung like that.
Doctor, So awesome.
Doctor, We were on our way to perform a surgery...
Doctor, But we would be honored to watch you perform it.
SpongeBob, Me? Perform a surgery?
Squidward," Oh, yeah, this is the life. And best of all, there's no SpongeBob here to ruin it."
SpongeBob," Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too."
Squidward, SpongeBob? No! What are you doing here?
Surgeon," Nighty night, Mr. Tentacles."
Squidward," Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!"
SpongeBob," Oh, hi, everybody."
surgeons," Hi, SpongeBob."
Doctor," Doctor, the patient's over here, and he's ready for you to begin."
Doctor," Oh, we're most eager to see which tool you select first."
SpongeBob," [looks for a tool] Hmm, mm—mm—mm—mm. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew. [picks up a spatula] Here we go!"
surgeons, Oh! Ah!
SpongeBob," Okay, SpongeBob, this can't be too hard. Just make an incision here, and— [operates with the spatula and ink sprays up] no! Shoot! [the heart flips] Son of a gun! [continues to work, but breaks Squidward's foot off] Ah, my bad."
Surgeon, I'll take that. [takes the foot]
SpongeBob," Ah-ha! [chops with spatula and makes sushi] Mmm, sushi."
SpongeBob," He's, uh, really going to pieces over this nose job."
SpongeBob," Oh, [chuckles] thank you! Let's try again, shall we?"
SpongeBob, Order up!
SpongeBob, Yow! That shouldn't be in there. [pulls ribbon and sees another one] Ooh! [pulls more ribbons out and a clipboard]
Doctor, What? [notices his clipboard is missing] Oh.
SpongeBob, Ta-da!
SpongeBob," Nurse, sponge."
SpongeBob," Thank you, nurse."
Doctor, I can't see! I can't see! I want to see!
Doctor, I still can't see.
SpongeBob, Ta-da!
SpongeBob," There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse."
Squidward, [wakes up and groans] What—what happened?
SpongeBob," I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look."
Squidward," SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!"
SpongeBob," Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!"
Squidward," Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—"
Squidward, No! [with a noisemaker] No! [with an elephant's trunk] No! [with clarinet] No! [with crabs nose] No! [with log] No! [with the face of Squilliam Fancyson] No! [with a reindeer's head] No! [with his house] No! [with real life octopus] No! [with car engine and it flares up] No-o-o-o! [sobbing]
Squidward," Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—"
SpongeBob, How's about the Squidward Classic?
Squidward," Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose."
SpongeBob," Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it."
SpongeBob, D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work. [takes off his surgery outfit]
Doctor, But you're a doctor. You're at work.
SpongeBob," No, I'm just a fry cook. [puts on Krusty Krab hat] But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye! [leaves]"
Doctor, Fry cook? Ooh. [faints in the green doctor's arms]
Squidward," Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market."
SpongeBob, Ta-dah! [SpongeBob's house dances around] I did it! I did it! I did it! I did- [slips on something and makes silly noises] [smashes into the door and when it opens SpongeBob falls out and makes a funny noise]
Gary, [slithers toward SpongeBob] Meow.
SpongeBob, [circles around Gary] I learned a magic trick!
Gary, [gets scared and hides in his shell] Meow? [his eyes come out of his shell]
SpongeBob," Sorry, Gary, but I've been trying to learn this trick since I was a SpongeBoy. [gasps as Gary meows] I gotta show Patrick! [starts running toward Patrick's house and hits Norton]"
Norton, [spits out mail]
SpongeBob," [finishes running toward Patrick's house and knocks on his rock] Patrick, come on, I got to show you something! [slides into Patrick's rock and makes a silly noise. He then lifts up Patrick's rock.] Patrick? He's not home. [Patrick's rock falls on him and he makes a grunt-like noise] Oh! Squidward! [Squidward goes into his trash can and slides it into his house and pretends like he's not home] Squidward! Squidward, Squidward, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, Squidward, Squidward?"
Squidward," If he thinks I'm out, he'll go away. [SpongeBob continues to say ""Squidward"" and his eye goes through Squidward's door.]"
SpongeBob, [talks through his eye] Squidward! I'm so glad you're home. Got a magic trick to show ya!
Squidward, I hate magic.
SpongeBob, How could anyone hate magic? It's... [close-up of his face] ...magical.
Squidward," [sighs] Okay, show me the trick."
SpongeBob," [gasps in joy as Squidward runs away] Pick a card- oh. [Squidward runs out of his house, closes the door, and swallows the key. Squidward hums] Watch closely, Squidward. The hand is quicker than the eye."
Squidward, [groans and swallows his eyes] Can't watch. No eyes. Sorry.
SpongeBob, [groans and drops his cards] I want to show my trick to somebody. [cries and runs away while Squidward laughs and bumps into his front door]
Puff," [scene changes to Mrs. Puff having a student with braces take a drivers test] You're the best driving student I've ever had, Rodger. Kudos. [Rodger laughs]"
SpongeBob, [as he's running to Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff!
Puff," [scared] Rodger, we have to move now! Punch it! [as the boat is driving, she accidentally hits a fire hydrant] I think we lost him. [SpongeBob arrives with the cards in his hand. Mrs. Puff makes a small scream]"
SpongeBob," Mrs. Puff, you got to see my magic trick! [Mrs. Puff and Rodger scream and the boat crashes onto a rock. Rodger's braces break, while SpongeBob stands up with his cards] Pick a card, any card!"
Puff," Hold on, SpongeBob, I have a trick to show you first. [Mrs. Puff puffs and she floats into the air] Sorry, Rodger, we'll pick this up next week!"
SpongeBob," [hanging onto Mrs. Puff] Wait, Mrs. Puff, you didn't see my trick!"
Puff," [frowns] Okay, show me the trick already."
SpongeBob," [gets off Mrs. Puff and shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [SpongeBob falls down and slams onto Sandy's treedome. He slides down the treedome happily until he reaches the floor] Sandy! [goes inside the treedome and puts on his water helmet] Sandy, I gotta show you this. [he shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [SpongeBob screams and drops all his cards as Sandy, who is watering her grass, is missing her head] Sandy? [SpongeBob touches the helmet and it falls off. SpongeBob looks to see where the head is] Where's your head?"
Sandy," Oh, sorry, SpongeBob, didn't mean to spook ya. My head's in another dimension, observing. [cuts to Sandy in the Swamp, observing one of the trees. In the background, Bubble Bass and Patrick are on a log, trying to escape a group of crocodiles on their hovercraft]"
SpongeBob," [leaving] Uh-huh, okay, I'll come back later when you have a head."
Sandy, It should be back by Thursday. Friday at the latest. [she starts watering her grass again]
Krabs, [SpongeBob runs to Mr. Krabs' house and rings the bell] Who is it? [opens his door]
SpongeBob," [shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [Mr. Krabs gets frightened]"
Krabs," [he smashes SpongeBob's head, making him bounce up and down and make music like an accordion] Magic, eh, boyo? [he leans his eyes toward him] Is this by any chance a trick where you produce money coins from behind people's ears? [as he's winking twice] Wink wink, hmm?"
SpongeBob, [crouches down a little] No.
Krabs, Then what's the point? [closes his door angrily]
SpongeBob," [SpongeBob gets upset] Ah! [goes to Fred's home and rings his doorbell, which is a miniature leg]] Hi, Fred! [shows his cards] I've got a magic trick that's going to dazzle you!"
Fred," [looks with interest] Ooh! Are you going to saw my leg in half, or make it disappear, or pull a rabbit out of it?"
SpongeBob," [loses his smile] Uh, no, this isn't going to involve your leg."
Fred," [quickly looks at his watch] Ooh, gotta go, SpongeBob. I'm washing my thighs tonight. [goes inside and closes the door, only to accidentally cut his leg because of the door, while SpongeBob is surprised] My leg!"
SpongeBob," [sighs as he walks into a kelp forest] Why won't anyone watch my trick?! [falls onto the ground while the word ""trick"" flies into the air, causing the leaves on the kelp trees to fall down onto SpongeBob] [SpongeBob gets up, covered with leaves. He slightly pulls his kelp mustache, and then sees two pieces of wood and a rock. A lightbulb appears on top of SpongeBob] Hey, that gives me an idea! [scene cuts to SpongeBob putting the final touches on his rock people] There. Good evening, folks, I am the Great Spongedini! Now watch closely, [reveals his cards] the hand is quicker than the eye. Pick a card. Any card. [SpongeBob inhales all the magic playing cards into his mouth, and then starts his magic trick.]"
Spongedini," Huh? [The Great Spongedini pulls the ribbon out of his left sleeve, but then reveals a red, blue, pink, green, and orange ribbon that covers the whole screen. Then the scene becomes spirally and gets put into a magic hat. Then, the white screen turns back to the kelp forest and SpongeBob pulls himself out of the magic hat in a pink bunny suit, ending his magic trick.]"
SpongeBob," Ta-dah! [notices that the audience he made was fake and didn't respond to his magic trick.] Oh... I still wish Patrick was here to see it. [then he notices Patrick sitting on a mushroom, hanging onto another mushroom.]"
Patrick," [off-screen] I saw it, SpongeBob! [on-screen] It was astonishable! [Patrick falls of the mushroom and falls flat onto the ground, and pulls himself off the ground.]"
SpongeBob," [hugging Patrick] Oh, Patrick! You showed up just in time. What was your favorite part?"
Patrick," Uh... My favorite part was... uh...""Ta-dah!"". I missed everything before that."
SpongeBob," Oh, then you haven't seen seen anything yet! [he grabs a hold of Patrick's hand. The two spin around and then they disappear into a magic hat. Some confetti and a card come out of the hat as the two laugh. Fireworks also start coming out of the hat, while the rock creatures stand inanimate.]"
SpongeBob," ♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude♪"
Squidward," Oh, is that supposed to be singing? [paint brushes fall on the floor] I am putting that one on SpongeBob. [to SpongeBob] Would you clam up, SpongeBob? I am trying to paint in here!"
SpongeBob, ♪I cherish my fellow residents...♪
Squidward," SpongeBob, why are you doing this?"
SpongeBob," Oh, I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!"
